# AI Image Generator Application
Welcome to the AI Image Generator App! This full-stack web app employs the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, Vite.js, and the OpenAI API to craft lifelike images.The application is accessible to everyone through this [link](https://artify-gen-ai.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

* PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store photo links generated by the OpenAI API.
* Express.js: A back-end web application framework for Node.js used to create a RESTful API.
* React.js: A front-end JavaScript library used to create the user interface and interact with the API.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for the back-end server.
* OpenAI API: An artificial intelligence API that generates high-quality images based on user inputs.
* Cloudinary: An end-to-end image and video management platform that stores generated photos.
* Vite.js: A build tool that serves the website in development and optimizes the website for production.


## How it Works
1. User clicks the "create" button
2. User can choose to type anything or clicks the "surprise me" button to generate a random prompt
3. User clicks the "Generate" button
4. The application sends a request to the OpenAI API with the specified parameters
5. The OpenAI API generates a high-quality image based on the parameters
6. The application stores the generated image in Cloudinary and retrieves the image URL
7. The application stores the image URL in PostgreSQL
8. User can choose to share with the community by clicking the "share" button
9. The application displays the generated image to the user at the Home page.
